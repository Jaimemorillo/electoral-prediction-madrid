# Network Analysis of the Madrid Regional Election Campaign

In this repository I will place my TFG (Thesis) Mathematics code, which has been used to analyze the electoral campaign on Twitter for the elections of the Community of Madrid 2021.

## Code
- read_tweets.ipynb: It is used to perform a structural analysis of the network.
- comunidades_tweets.ipynb: It is used to analyze the network communities, one of the purposes is to be able to make a prediction of the electoral result.
